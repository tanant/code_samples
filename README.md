# code_samples
Not guaranteed to compile due to missing links etc, this is a collection of sample code to demonstrate my code style and competencies


FrameCatcher - a C++ nuke plugin (Nuke 7, 8) that sits in the node stream, logging what frames have been requested downstream. Paired with some nuke support code

3DE_lensdistortion - just some TCL to help with migrating our old lensdistortion plugins, to the newer LDPK 1.7 style. Essentially, someone just changed the name.
